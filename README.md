# Musical-Needleman
Use of Needleman and other algorithm for music alignment


Here you can find some code around alignment, Needlement algorithm and music. This project is for a class validation at IRCAM, ATIAM dispensed by Mr. Philippe Esling.

You can find the code in atiam-fpa.py, the biggest functions are in functions.py, a short sript test_function.py is used to benchmark the Needleman implementation. 

The files .dist are used to set-up distances for the Needleman algorithm, atiam-fpa.pkl contain some title and composers name, atiam-fpa/ some midi files to work with.

The result of long computations are saved in Data/ you can easily open them with pickle.

Finaly, Rapport/ contains a pdf report in french and the .tex source, in wich we explain the methology and design choices.
